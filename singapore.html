    <p> Singapore’s unemployment rate is among the lowest compared to the other countries, even
during pandemic or other difficult periods where there were increases
    <br><br>
        SINGAPORE'S unemployment rates fell across the board in August, but the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) warned of risks of an economic slowdown that could dampen the labour market.
    <br><br>
    Overall unemployment rate slid to 1.9 per cent in August; resident unemployment, to 2.7 per cent and citizen unemployment rate, to 2.8 per cent, according to MOM's monthly unemployment situation report on Friday (Oct 7). All three rates were 0.2 percentage point lower than their levels in July.
    <br><br>
        The ministry noted that 64,800 residents were unemployed in August, among whom 57,600 were citizens.
    <br><br>
    This is the lowest level the unemployment rates have fallen to since March 2016. Unemployment figures used to be released on a quarterly basis until mid-2020, when the ministry said it wanted to track the situation more closely during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>How they did it?</h4>
     <br><br>
    <p>Support from the government helped to boost the city-state’s GDP and labour market, therefore reducing the impact of the pandemic on the economy, it said in the report.
    <br><br>
    Schemes like the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for wage support, SGUnited Jobs and Skills package and Jobs Growth Incentive to promote hiring of locals, helped reduce job losses and supported residents in finding jobs and learning new skills</p>
