    <h1>Types of Unemployment</h1>
    <h3>Types of Unemployment</h3>
    <p>Beyond voluntary and involuntary, some unemployment types take into account factors such as the strength of the economy, length of joblessness, and workplace changes. Following are eight types of unemployment, including definitions and examples:</p>
    <br>
    <h3>1. Cyclical Unemployment</h3>
    <p>Frictional unemployment is the result of people voluntarily leaving their jobs. People who’ve resigned from their jobs and graduates seeking their first jobs need time to find employment, leaving them unemployed in the interim. Looking for a job, seeking a replacement employee, and finding the right employee for a job take time, but frictional unemployment isn’t necessarily bad. This type of unemployment usually is short term, and it’s present even in a healthy economy as people leave their jobs to seek new opportunities. The economy that emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic saw frictional unemployment, for example, when employers asked employees to return to work in person after they’d worked remotely for many months. Many employees who preferred to work from home voluntarily left their jobs in search of roles that better fit their needs.</p>

    <p>Frictional unemployment is the result of people voluntarily leaving their jobs. People who’ve resigned from their jobs and graduates seeking their first jobs need time to find employment, leaving them unemployed in the interim. Looking for a job, seeking a replacement employee, and finding the right employee for a job take time, but frictional unemployment isn’t necessarily bad. This type of unemployment usually is short term, and it’s present even in a healthy economy as people leave their jobs to seek new opportunities. The economy that emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic saw frictional unemployment, for example, when employers asked employees to return to work in person after they’d worked remotely for many months. Many employees who preferred to work from home voluntarily left their jobs in search of roles that better fit their needs.</p>
    <br>
  <h3>3. Structural Unemployment</h3>
  <p>Fundamental changes in the economy and labor markets, such as evolving technology, government policies, and competition, can create structural unemployment. This means that while jobs are available, the people who could fill those roles either don’t have the right skills for them or aren’t in the right location. Manufacturing employees may contribute to structural unemployment, for example, when the requirements of their jobs change, leaving them unemployed because they no longer possess the right technological skills. Another example can occur when a business moves jobs to a location that’s too far away for employees to travel to, leaving those employees without work. Structural unemployment typically lasts longer than frictional unemployment, sometimes causing an erosion of those unemployed people’s skills or leaving them discouraged from looking for work.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>4. Natural Unemployment</h3>
  <p>Natural unemployment is the combination of frictional and structural unemployment. It refers to the lowest unemployment level a healthy economy can sustain without causing inflation. This type of unemployment is ever present: People are always voluntarily looking for new jobs, causing frictional unemployment, and job skill requirements are always evolving, causing structural unemployment. It’s common for people to voluntarily leave jobs and for positions to move to other parts of the world, for example, driving the natural unemployment rate.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>5. Long-Term Unemployment</h3>
  <p>The BLS classifies people who’ve been unemployed for 27 weeks or more and who’ve actively sought employment in the past four weeks as long-term unemployed. Cyclical and structural unemployment drive long-term unemployment. The 2008 recession, for example, caused a large increase in cyclical unemployment. Some individuals who were unemployed for a long time as a result of the economic downturn found themselves no longer fit for the skills the jobs required, driving structural unemployment. The repercussions of long-term unemployment for individuals can also have a negative effect on the economy. That can contribute to more cyclical unemployment — and lead to more long-term unemployment.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>6. Seasonal Unemployment</h3>
  <p>Seasonal jobs are limited to a certain time period, sometimes leaving people who work in those jobs without employment after the season ends. Seasonal unemployment is the result of the decreased demand in labor that occurs at each season’s end, making the seasonal rate more predictable than other types of unemployment. Seasonal unemployment often occurs in tourist areas, where attractions often are open only during a certain time of the year. Theme parks, for example, employ workers only during their operational seasons, which in many climates is limited. A ski lodge’s employees generally work only when people are skiing. Agricultural workers’ jobs are timed to when crops are in season.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>7. Classical Unemployment</h3>
  <p>Classical unemployment, also known as real-wage unemployment, occurs when real wages, or the cost of employing a worker, are too high. This circumstance leaves companies unable to afford all the workers who are available.
    <br>

When real wages are too high, they’re greater than the benefit the employer gets from the labor an employee provides. Companies that can’t afford real wages decide not to hire as many people as are seeking jobs. An example of classical unemployment is when workers negotiate for a minimum salary that’s more than what a company can afford, making hiring those employees too costly for that company and leaving those workers unemployed.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>8. Underemployment</h3>
<p>Underemployment differs from unemployment in that it describes people who are working, but aren’t employed at their full capability. Measuring underemployment shows how effectively the economy is using the labor force’s skills, experience, and work availability. Following are the categories of underemployment:
  <br></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Visible underemployment.</strong> With visible underemployment, employees work part time despite their desire to work more hours. Underemployed people, such as office employees who can find only part-time roles, may work multiple jobs to earn the equivalent of a full-time salary.</li>
    <li><strong>Invisible underemployment.</strong> When individuals who can’t find a job in their chosen field take a job that isn’t in line with their experience and skills, they represent invisible underemployment. Their work often pays less than a role that’s more in line with their background would pay. A person with an engineering degree working at a coffee shop is an example of invisible underemployment.</li>
  </ul>
