            <h3>What do you think the unemployment problem. Is it a big social problem?</h3>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">The changing problem of unemployment these days is a problem in many countries, and unemployment, especially among young people, is a big problem. And unemployment among young people has many negative consequences. Usually, young people who cannot find a job for a very long time get depressed, they lose their confidence, and they like a lot. The addition of health negative health outcomes stems from depression that comes from not finding a job. Young people think that what they think is my place and think badly about what I can do. I really do not like this problem. So, it is one of the serious problems of society.</p>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h3>How do you think to solve the unemployment problems?</h3>
                <p>That needs to be addressed. So, I think they should look at the characteristics of young people. So, we must give them good support to solve the problem with good software technology. This is because then and part of the data that solves means that schools need to work together to give their children their gardens and the best for their parents there. It also needs a kind of government role and Korea needs it compared to other countries in this regard. With some success, there are possibilities such as some social problems in Korean society as well as Kate. 
                Second thing, we need to at university level. Then we need to focus on giving students most skills. In the live market like a reward return on skills is larger than return to some knowledge and it is set. Therefore, like you can try to keep most of the subjects in an alert right wait so that they should not know what to do again. So that and then like give them skills that are transferable from one area to another area. I think that if we will be able to do that. I think that would give a lot of advantage for young people.

            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h3>Which country have the most super unemployment problems and which countries do you think that they have solved?</h3>
                <p>I think usulike corn trees where you have elevated levels of corruption no democracy then poor infrastructure that those countries usually, they will also have lack of opportunities for many people. And especially like a young people they feel lost. I think that deep a good example of if in many textbooks. you see about the case of South Korea I have been unemployment for me. although like unemployment still is a problem among young people.
                But how to say if you compare like what was 50 years ago, the situation improved much better. So therefore, like because that if you see that countries of the comparable size like South Korea the actual date did not move in the same direction. So therefore, like that are some advantages in the case of South Korea. but of course, like every country they are trying to do their best. but like economic development like depends on manufacturers. And like successful one is the case of South Korea. and then works like you can also look at the case of the US or like you can look at the European countries. but still, I think that the amount of OECD countries problem with like Germany, France might have a good system. and Corazon Katherine is relative death part of those countries sack here. I see that some Samsung's problem that Korea can learn from German system. German system is good.
